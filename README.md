This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that integrates traditional ML techniques with Large Language Model (LLM)–based text representations. The pipeline covers data ingestion, text preprocessing, feature generation using transformer-based embeddings, model training and evaluation, and semantic search for information retrieval.

The implementation leverages Python, scikit-learn, and sentence-transformer models to show how dense LLM embeddings can be combined with classical machine learning algorithms for efficient and interpretable text classification. The project also includes a semantic similarity module that enables retrieval of relevant documents based on natural language queries.

This work highlights practical applications of NLP and LLMs in real-world scenarios, emphasizing reproducibility, clean pipeline design, and scalability.
